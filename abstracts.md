# abstract

the functional paradigm is integral to javascript

inherits from scheme

how it differs from imperative



benefits:
 concise
 reusable
 DRY! 4 REAL this time


## talk 1: Introduction to FP
In the first talk we will look at the fundamental principles that underpin the functional programming paradigm.
We introduce some of basic techniques that makes functional programming so powerful. 
These are techniques you can easily apply to your codebase to increase readability and reusability.


## talk 2: null cant hurt you anymore

Talk 1 will only get you so far, use interfaces to mitigate the common pitfalls encountered when writing JavaScript.

Encapsulates uncertainty.

Code the happy path.

Effects. Interacting with the filthy outside world

no throwing indoors!

be specific!

respect types even if javascript doesn't

difference between Exception and Error


## talk 3: 12 factor functions

Armed with our new techniques we will build a real world application, in the functional style.
